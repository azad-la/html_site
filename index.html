        <h1>Hello, I'm Darren.</h1>
        <h2>As an analytics implementation lead, I spent 5 years driving continuous improvements in the quality, reliability and scope of front-end data for an award-winning global retailer.</h2> 
            <section id="epitch">
                <h3>My real passion however, is for finding insights in the data itself.   Prior to my work as implementation lead, I was employed as senior ecommerce analyst at the same company.   I really enjoyed testing theories, finding explanations in the data and presenting this visually.   One of my key strengths is that I am committed to ongoing learning and improvement and I have recently completed the Professional Certificate in Data Analytics at Imperial College which allowed me to pick up new skills in the area predictive and prescriptive analytics through machine learning.  
                Having spent the majority of my career in ecommerce, I am now looking to redirect my career to apply my data skills and experience in a sector that drives beneficial change.</h3>
