            <h2>As an analytics implementation lead, I spent 5 years driving continuous improvements in the quality, reliability and scope of the data collected for an award-winning global retailer.</h2> 
            <p>My real passion however, is for finding insights in the data itself.  Prior to my work as an implementation lead, I was the senior ecommerce analyst at the same company.  I really enjoyed testing theories, finding explanations in the data and presenting this visually.  
            One of my key strengths is that I am committed to ongoing learning and development 
            Since I had no formal data qualification, I decided to fix this and in November of last year, signed up to study for a professional certificate in Data Analytics, which also allowed me to pick up new skills in the area of machine learning and to finally learn Python.  
            I am now looking to redirect my career to apply my data skills and experience in a sector that drives change</p>
