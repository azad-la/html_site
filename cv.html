            <p><strong>Analytics Lead</strong>, Lovehoney, Bath, UK</p>
            <p>November 2018 – November 2023</p>
            <p>- Overall stewardship for the collection and distribution of all front-end data for global properties (UK, US, AU, NZ & CA) and first point of contact for all website tracking requirements</p>
            <p>- Ability to strategize, plan, build, quality test, deploy and audit digital analytics implementations including but not limited to the following technologies:</p> 
            <p>Google Analytics | Google Ads | Bing Ads | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok | Ampliance | Iterable | Lean Convert | ContentSquare | Monetate | One Trust | Impact | Shareasale | Webgains | Commission Factory | FingerprintJS | Ometria | Neocom</p>
            <p>- Planning and delivery of tracking to enable best practice reporting of new and existing website features and robust measurement of marketing channels & user behaviour activities</p>
            <p>- Ensuring compliance with regulation, proactively driving high data quality with a constant focus on the commercial opportunities that the data underpin</p>
            <p>- Thought leadership on tracking challenges brought about by technological and legislative changes</p>
            <p>- Ensuring accuracy, structure and usefulness of data into the digital analytics ecosystem as per business requirements</p>
            <p>- Time-management and triage of tickets</p> 
            <p>- Mentoring junior team members</p>
            <h4>Personal Achievements Included</h4>
            <p>- Implemented Google Tag Manager Server-Side across Global properties. This work recovered more than 5% of Google Analytics tracking that was lost to browser tracking updates and also enabled the transition to a new affiliate network (new network could only operate with server-side tracking).  This reduced network overheads, enabled growth of affiliate network and provided improved functionality and more granular tracking</p>
            <p>- Delivered ‘One Container Project’. This was the unification of historic global Google Tag Manager properties into one GTM container.  This vastly reduced the work required for each GTM update, increasing work efficiency by roughly 80%</p>
            <p>- Implemented GA4 across Global properties.  Google Analytics 4 was a ‘forced’ migration due to the retirement of Universal Analytics (GA3). This work required:</p>
            <p>• Close collaboration with multiple teams to ensure expectations were managed and goals were successfully met</p>
            <p>• Rewriting of data layer architecture to improve scope and efficiency adhering to updated GA4 schema and with consideration given for the change in expected data consumption (switching from the GA UI to BigQuery & Apache Superset)</p>
            <p>• Testing of the event driven-data journey from data layer triggers through to BigQuery</p>
            <p>• Set up of GA4 environment</p>
            <p>• Production of ‘living’ data dictionary</p>
