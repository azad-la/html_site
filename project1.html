            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Objective</h3>
                <p>This report was produced in answer to the questions briefed by the Airbnb team in Rio:<br>What key metrics should be monitored over time, to measure the success of the team's efforts in improving the guest host matching process and why?
                <br>What areas should we invest in to increase the number of successful bookings in Rio de Janeiro?<br>There is also interest from executives at Airbnb about the work you are doing, 
                and a desire to understand the broader framing of the challenge of matching supply and demand, thinking beyond the data provided.  What other research, experiments, or approaches could help the company get more clarity on the problem?</p>
            <h3>1.3 Key Findings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>More than 50% of all book_it events did not result in a booking and we examined why that might be using machine learning methods.  Unfortunately we were unable to ascertain a reliable pattern that provided insight to this.  Instead we have recommended that further analysis be carried out and have recommended further datasets that might help with this.</li>
                    <li>The count of reviews appeared to be a significant factor in guests propensity to book a particular property.  We also found that new bookers seem to be more important as a component of a successful booking and have recommended that Airbnb focus on a post travel customer relationship </li>
                    <li>Recommended that Airbnb focus its marketing budget in the front end of year only since this is when first contact is made for booking enquiries</li>
                </ul>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I was interested in this particular problem as I have many years experience working in travel and ecommerce, so the opportunity to perform some analysis on one of the industry’s great success stories appealed.
                <br>Airbnb was founded by three friends in the summer of 2008 and emerged into an internet juggernaut transforming the way people book and rent travel accommodation.  The sure sign of any successful business is that the brand name evolves into a verb, and sure enough, ‘to Airbnb it’ can now refer to the renting or or hiring of homes or rooms, since Airbnb is two side marketplace.  
                <br>The Airbnb booking process is fairly simple; a guest finds an available room (listing) that they like, they then contact the host to ask further questions or to book.
                <br>There are three ways to contact the host:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>'Contact_me'</li>
                    <li>'Book_it’</li>
                    <li>'Instant_book'</li>
                </ol>
            <p>Instant_book is automatically accepted by the host, so the assumption here is that the property’s availability is linked to Airbnb, or managed by it.  <br>Contact_me’ and ‘book_it’ methods require the host to confirm.  </p>
            <p>In order for the business to grow, Airbnb would like to increase the number of bookings.  <br>To achieve this, the company has supplied 3 datasets which are to be analysed with appropriate responses given for:</p>
            <p>The key questions that have been asked are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What key metrics should be monitored over time?</li>
                    <li>What areas should we invest in to increase the number of successful bookings in Rio de Janeiro?</li>   
                </ul>
            <p>In approaching this problem, I first considered the different facets of the business that can be influenced.  AirBnB want to increase bookings.  The factors that have to be overcome in order to do this include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ensuring the guest is able to access the Airbnb app/website</li>
                <li>Ensuring the guest is able to find a property that suits their requirements</li> 
                <li>The required property being available for the dates required</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So, my question was, is there anything in the data that can provide Airbnb with some information that can remove obstacles for this part of the journey?    
            <br>In this instance, we have no app performance data which might help with the first two steps.  However for the 3rd step, whilst we can’t control which dates are available, we can look at the types of neighbourhood, homes and departure dates that are most popular with guests.  
            In particular, a pertinent question might be, is there a way to find out which properties are most in demand, but not available?  This could help the Airbnb team to look for similar properties to those that often have high occupancy.  
            Here we are interested in the supply chain side of the business, matching demand to supply.<br>In the second part of this journey, the guest will contact the host.  The factors that have to be overcome in order to do this include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The host replying and replying within a desired response time </li>
                <li>The host being able to effectively answer questions about the property </li>
                <li>The guests being satisfied with the responses</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The second part of the journey raises multiple questions such as do successful bookings have a faster response time than unsuccessful ones?  Does this change depending on the origin of the guest?  Maybe the host prefer not to receive certain types of guest?  Additionally other factors could play into the decision such as party size or seasonality.  Or maybe something as seemingly trivial as the number of number of words in a user profile have some sort of impact?</p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Joining Data & Cleaning</h3>
        <p><strong>The supplied datasets were:</strong></p> 
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Contacts</strong> - 27,887 rows x 14 columns - featuring a row for every time that a user made an enquiry for a stay at a listing in Rio de Janeiro</li>
                <li><strong>Listings</strong> - 13,038 rows x 4 columns - featuring data for every listing (property) on the market</li>
                <li><strong>Contacts</strong> - 31,525 rows x 3 columns - featuring data for every user.  No personally Identifiable Information</li>
            </ol>
        <p><strong>Some data cleaning was required as follows:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contacts - first interaction date was not in a date format as many rows had an addition dot zero attached</li>
                <li>Listings - total_reviews had about 40 rows with negative counts.  These were made positive</li>
                <li>Users - removed duplicate rows </li>
                <li>Establish match between contacts [‘id_guest_anon’] and users [‘id_user_anon] for joining tables</li>
                <li>All tables were joined using Pandas Merge.  The joined table is an extension of the contacts table,  so row is a guest enquiry but also contains details on the user and the property</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>New features created:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lead time</strong> - time in days from confirmed booking timestamp to check in date</li>
                <li><strong>Acceptance time</strong> - time in hours from first interaction to acceptance time</li>
                <li><strong>Overbooking</strong> - binary value, 1 = book_it events with no booking timestamp</li>
                <li><strong>Booking</strong> - binary value, 1  = booking timestamp (‘ts_booking_at’) present</li>
            </ul>>
        <h3>3.2 Machine Learning Prep</h3>
            <p>There were many features in the dataset with the potential to interact with each other resulting in hidden patterns that work together to influence bookings. 
            <img src="assets/images/ml - dataset - numerical - correlations.PNG" alt="Description of the image">
            <br>The only way to realistically address all of these is to employ machine learning and use computationally intensive methods to find patterns in the data.<br>Having been unsuccessful in identifying patterns inherent in failed book_it events, I looked to machine learning algorithms again to see if we could successfully predict whether a query will convert to a booking.  By unpicking this we might be able to find common factors that will help inform Airbnb’s marketing, merchandising (ecommerce) and supply chain strategies.
            <br>The first step was to define our problem.
            <br><strong>‘Can we predict whether a query will result in a booking using patterns found in previous rental enquiries?’</strong></p>
            <p>The second step was to refine our dataset. I looked at whether any values were strongly correlated with our target variable.  The image on the right shows correlations for numerical values in the dataset, however it turned out that quite a few categorical values were highly correlated.  I removed any that would <br>only be populated in the event of a booking since these would bias the results. </p>
            <p>Bookings were defined as an enquiry with a booking timestamp.<br>Our target variable was the column ‘booking’ which was a binary value; <br>where 1 = booking, 2 = non-booking</p>
